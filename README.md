# elementary OS - Web

## What?

elementary OS desktop replica but for web.


## Why?

elementary OS is my primary desktop OS and I like how it looks. So, I'm trying to build the UI by myself. I'm also learning Vue along the way. Inspired from [macos-web](https://github.com/PuruVJ/macos-web).

## Stack

## Can I contribute?
Sure. Thank you for asking.
